# My Tic-Tac-Toe game

In an attempt to practice my web dev skills (as a beginner), I attempted to create my own version of the classic tic-tac-toe game.
You can try it yourself at https://claudianicolea.github.io/tic-tac-toe/ . Enjoy!

I used the minimax algorithm to compute the bot's moves, so it should be impossible to defeat, always resulting in a tie or the bot's win. However, it is still great fun playing :)
Good luck!
